# Conversation log (2026-02-03)

I do not retain full conversation transcripts or prior sessions. This log captures the available in-session summary of actions and decisions.

## Summary of work

- Produced refined plan and Python implementation spec for the html2md skill.
- Scaffolded project layout under `html2md/scripts/skill` and added templates/tests.
- Refactored structure to match the requested skeleton; added `html2md/SKILL.md` placeholder.
- Moved `plan.md` into `html2md/references/plan.md`.
- Added root config files: `html2md/pyproject.toml`, `html2md/.pythonversion`, `html2md/README.md`.
- Initialized `html2md/.venv`.
- Resolved dependency conflict by pinning `trafilatura==2.0.0` and `lxml==5.3.0`.
- Ran `uv sync`, producing `html2md/uv.lock`.

## Current structure (high level)

- `html2md/SKILL.md`
- `html2md/scripts/skill/` (package scaffolding)
