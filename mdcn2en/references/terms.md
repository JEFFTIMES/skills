# Term Base Guidance

Use the glossary to keep terminology consistent across translations.

- Prefer product names and proper nouns as-is unless a standard English name exists.
- For acronyms, store the English expansion only if it is official.
- Avoid adding ambiguous terms; wait for clear context.
- Keep entries short and stable; do not add full sentences.
- If a term conflicts with an existing entry, prefer the more official translation.
